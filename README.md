### NOTES
            
       1. If deploy many copies of a set of microservices, how to route to the service?
            
            public class FooRouter implements GroupRouter{
                 public String replaceHolder(){
                      return "#xxx#";
                 }
                 public String replaceValue(Object obj) {
                      // See the demo: CatServiceGroupRouterForK8S.java
                      // Anyway, coding to ensure all the data only in the dbs connected by the target services
                      // each set of services connect diffent db and cache, one set include: storage, db, cache, 
                      // and your program 
                      // all in docker, all in k8s, set/k8s namespace
                 }
            }
            @ReyClient(value = "http://${service.demo}/xxx", groupRouter = FooRouter.class)
            
            config:
            # when write/read db, sharding db can't support more TPS
            # we set the k8s namespace: prod_0, prod_1, prod_2 ....
            # k8s ingress to front service(no connection to DB), front service call service-demo
            # by this way, one set of services' TPS is 10000, deploy 10 sets, TPS become almost 100000
            service.demo=service-demo.prod#xxx#
